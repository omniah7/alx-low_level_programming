 * main - prints all possible different combinations of two two-digits

 * The two numbers should be separated by a space
 * All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01
 * The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
 * The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order
 * 00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1
 * You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
 * You can only use putchar eight times maximum in your code
 * You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
 * Return: 0
